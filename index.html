  <h1>Hades II Revenue Estimates</h1>

  <p>
    Public estimates suggest that Hades II has generated tens of millions of dollars in revenue so far, but all figures are third-party estimates rather than official numbers from Supergiant Games. Different analytics sites use different models, so numbers vary and should be treated as approximations.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Revenue Estimates</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The stats site Games-Stats estimates Hades II’s Steam revenue at roughly 21 million USD during its early period in 2024.
    </li>
    <li>
      An analysis by Alinea Analytics (via App2Top) reports over 2 million copies sold on Steam in about 16 months of early access, with gross revenue in the range of roughly 50–55 million USD on Steam alone.
    </li>
    <li>
      Gamalytic’s model lists estimated gross revenue for the base game on Steam at about 50–75 million USD (with a central figure around 73.6 million USD), again only covering Steam and based on their own estimation methods.
    </li>
    <li>
      A Steam revenue calculator site currently estimates a little over 100 million USD in gross revenue and around 30+ million USD net after taxes, platform fees, refunds, and discounts, but this is also a model-based estimate rather than confirmed data.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Important Caveats</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      None of these numbers are official; Supergiant Games has not published a precise revenue figure for Hades II.
    </li>
    <li>
      Most estimates only cover Steam and may exclude revenue from other stores or platforms, so total franchise revenue for Hades II could be higher than Steam-only estimates suggest.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each analytics site (Games-Stats, Alinea Analytics/App2Top, Gamalytic, and Steam Revenue Calculator) uses its own proprietary model, which is why their figures differ.
    </li>
  </ul>
