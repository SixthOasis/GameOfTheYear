  <P> Hades II became popular due to its ability to build on the original's successful formula: 
      it offers improved, more complex gameplay, richer story and characters, and an addictive progression loop that makes every run feel worthwhile. 
      This was amplified by developer Supergiant Games' use of a successful early access period to build hype and incorporate player feedback, 
      which helped it become a highly anticipated sequel before its full release.</P>
