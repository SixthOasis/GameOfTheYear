  <h1>Hades II Revenue </h1>
</div>
<div class="cont1">
  <p>
    Public estimates suggest that Hades II has generated tens of millions of dollars in revenue so far, but all figures are third party estimates rather than official numbers from Supergiant Games. Different analytics sites use different models, so numbers vary and should be treated as approximations.

  <h2>Key Revenue Estimates</h2>
</div>
  <div class="cont2">

  <ul>
    <li>
      The stats site Games-Stats estimates Hades II’s Steam revenue at roughly 21 million USD during its early period in 2024.
    </li>
    <li>
      An analysis by Alinea Analytics (via App2Top) reports over 2 million copies sold on Steam in about 16 months of early access, with gross revenue in the range of roughly 50-55 million USD on Steam alone.
    </li>
    <li>
      Gamalytic’s model lists estimated gross revenue for the base game on Steam at about 50-75 million USD, again only covering Steam and based on their own estimation methods.
    </li>
    <li>
      A Steam revenue calculator site currently estimates a little over 100 million USD in gross revenue and around 30+ million USD net after taxes, platform fees, refunds, and discounts, but this is also a model based estimate rather than confirmed data.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Important notes</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="cont3">
  <ul>
    <li>
      None of these numbers are official; Supergiant Games has not published a precise revenue figure for Hades II.
    </li>
    <li>
      Most estimates only cover Steam and may not show revenue from other stores or platforms, so total franchise revenue for Hades II could be higher than Steam only estimates suggest.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each analytics site (Games-Stats, Alinea Analytics/App2Top, Gamalytic, and Steam Revenue Calculator) uses its own proprietary model, which is why their figures differ.
